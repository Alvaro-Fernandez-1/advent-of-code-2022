# Advent Of Code 2022
I probably shouldn't have ignored this the past two years

### Day 1
A python list initialized to [0], then go through each line in a loop. If the line is empty then append a new 0 to the list, otherwise add the number to the last index. The variable currentElf wasn't even needed, I could have just done elves[-1]. Then max(elves) gets the highest one and for the three highest just sort it and get the three highest. If I had to optimize it I wouldn't keep an array with all of them, just keep the highest value, then at each empty line compare the current elf with the best elf and choose the larger one. For part 2 maybe keep an array of 3 initialized to [0,0,0], compare each elf to the third one and if larger move it there, then the second one and then first. That works fine for the 3 best but for a large amount like 100000 maybe a balanced binary tree for fast insertions? Anyway that's too much thinking about this problem.

### Day 2
Check each case except for loss (0 points) and add the corresponding result. In part 2 check all 9 cases and add the value corresponding to the play. It feels so wrong but it's about doing it quickly. Also I was up at 5 in the morning for this one so I have accurate times now. 6:28 for 1 star, top 983 global, 13:25 for both stars, top 1906 global. Maybe I should have hesitated less about making horrible hacky code but it still wouldn't have made me top 100. That was 3:43 for one star, 6:16 for both. If I had to do rock paper scissors again I'm not sure if I would use a bunch of if statements from the beginning or use the cleaner code that is shorter but harder to remember. Also the cleaner code version is definitely better but specific to rps. If there were more possible moves with a more complex graph of wins and losses then using modulo is useless. Instead I think I would use a function or class to make each play have a winsVS set with all the other plays it wins against. Then check if p1 is in p2's winsVS, if p2 is in p1's winsVS and if neither then it's a draw.
